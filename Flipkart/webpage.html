        <p style="text-align: justify; height: 16; font-style: italic;">Flipkart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company established in 2007. It started with a primary focus on online book sales and soon, 
            expanded to lifestyle products, electronics, home essentials and groceries. Today, Flipkart is the biggest online Indian marketplace competing with the world leader Amazon.
            Since 2010, the company has made a number of acquisitions including Letsbuy, Myntra, Jabong, eBay India, etc. In addition to its main office in Bengaluru, Flipkart has branch offices at Delhi and Mumbai. 
            Apart from India, the firm is registered in Singapore. In 2018, the US-based retail chain Walmart acquired majority stake in Flipkart.</p></h4><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify ; height: 16; font-style: italic;">FlipKart, being the E-commerce giant that it is in India, has a lot of enthusisatic international shoppers all over the world.
                     From electronics to kids' toys; Flipkart offers a wide range of products that the customers would just love to buy. But the problem begins when it comes to checking them out & shipping them in from India,
                      at an affordable shipping cost. Will Flipkart Ship Internationally though? Well, the answer is, not as of now.
                    So, as far as you're concerned as a shopper, you'd have to look for alternative shipping options as Flipkart shipping internationally is at a moo point for the time being!</p>
